## These are data structures implemented for cs271 at cs.luc.edu in Spring 2008.
#### Course was taught by Matt Bone, and interfaces/class hierarchies developed by Matt Bone.
#### Methods and such were implemented by me. I defined the implementation details.
#### This repo is good for quickly reviewing how to implement data structures in Java.
#### Compile using -cp option if your CLASSPATH variable is not set.
#### I have split this repo into separate projects and mavenized them.
#### It's now fairly easy to run the tests and compile the projects with maven.
